            <h2>My Biography.</h2>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, a budding artist, and a budding web developer.
                I love painting and I love reading.
                I have two sisters whom I love very much and I love all my friends. I started learning tech some years back and I've been in love with it since then.

            <p>
                I joined the program because I wanted to complete my tech education
                and harness all that the academy has to offer. I want to be equipped for job opportunities and
                learn from the best tutors and the word on the street is that AltsSchool Africa is one of the best.
